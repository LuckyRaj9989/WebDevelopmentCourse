    <p> Our love is something that is truly special and there is no other love like ours in the world. I feel as if I have won the lottery with you, someone who is so special and magical, who makes my life and my world a thousand times better just by being there. When I look at you, I know that I have truly hit the jackpot. All you have to do in order to warm my heart is to be the loving, caring person that you are. Together, we can do so much and help each other realize our dreams because we truly have a love that is special.<br>
        Sometimes when I look at the ocean or an especially large mountain range, I feel overwhelmed and small, but in a good way. It’s comforting to know there’s something out there bigger than I am. Something large and enduring that has lasted through the ages. Through harsh weather, storms and droughts, through changes in history and climate, the ocean keeps on rolling and the mountains keep on standing tall. When I think of you and our love and how I feel about you, I feel the same way. My love for you doesn’t make me feel small though, it makes me feel powerful and new. I look at you and I know that I will love you forever, through storms and droughts, through all the changes that will undoubtedly come our way. I will love you forever. There’s no changing that.<br>
        If I know one thing for certain, it is this – you always have my back. My best friend, my lover, my secret keeper, and my partner in crime. You are a perfect mix of naughty and nice. You keep things interesting with your mischievous pranks and practical jokes. You always keep me on my toes wondering what’s next! There is never a dull day with you. Thank you for coming into my life.<br>
        Just when I had given up on life and love – I met you. You changed everything. I love your innocent and trusting nature. You made me realize that the world is not black or white. They are shades of gray and all the other colors in the rainbow too. I will forever cherish you for bringing sunshine and joy into my life and teaching me to cherish every moment of life. To enjoy early morning sunrises, walks by the beach, or lazy Sunday afternoons instead of chasing intangible things. I love you with every ounce of my soul, forever and ever.<br>
        You have always been my biggest supporter and fan. You’ve always had my back and in your eyes, I can do nothing wrong which has built my confidence throughout my life. Thank you, darling, for loving me unconditionally and forever! You have made me the man I am today and I will always love you with all my heart. People say they would love to have a wife that would do anything for her husband. I have that in you and I appreciate all that you do and have always done in my life. You will be the love in my heart to eternity.<br>
        I never show what you mean to me as often as I should. I am trying to change that. I fall short of words to express what a blessing you have been to me. You have been my constant support through some of the toughest times in life. Your unwavering faith in my abilities and vision is the reason for my success today. You stood behind me and made immense sacrifices for us. You never get enough credit for this. I want you to know you are the reason for everything I have today. Without you all my success and wealth is meaningless. Now that we have worked so hard for what we always wanted – it is time for us to sit back and enjoy life. Let’s plan a trip around the world and do all the things we missed out on. Will you go on an adventure of a lifetime with me?<br>
        I wanted to take the time to tell you just how much you mean to me. You’ve become a rock in my life, something solid and secure I can lean on. Knowing you’re by my side makes me so eternally grateful, I can hardly put it into words. I had felt happiness before, but nothing prepared me for the happiness I feel when I’m with you. I don’t know what I said or did that made me lucky enough to deserve you, but I will spend the rest of my life trying to be the best man I can be so that you can be proud. Thank you for all that you do and have done for me. You have taught me what it is to love. You’ve shown me how beautiful life can be.<br>
        When you feel weak, I am here to be strong for you. When you are strong, I’m here to lift you up and make you stronger. When you are sad, I am here to bring a smile to your face. And when you are happy, I am here to enjoy every minute of it. Because you do all these things for me. When I am weak, you give me strength. When I am sad, you can make me smile every time. I am so grateful for you and our life together. As a devotionary I sit and pen down my words that I have found my perfect partner. I am here for you. I will always be here and you will always have my heart<br>
